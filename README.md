# Welcome!

This is nothing special. Just my first little React App with everything included that makes a React project a "real" React project:

- Unit Tests with React Test
- Global state management using the [zustand](https://github.com/pmndrs/zustand) library.
- some (fake) uploading functionality. (Nothing will be uploaded anywhere, but the app will look and feel "as if" when the user clicks the upload button.)
- reading and processing data from an API.

Since this one is supposed to show a few people how I approach a project of this kind, this project comes with [an official documentation.](https://mt-lampert.github.io/react-signup/) It will tell you everything I find interesting about it.

Feel welcome to join the journey, there's more to come, stay tuned!

# Welcome!

This is nothing special. Just my first little React App with everything included that makes a React project a "real" React project:

- Unit Tests with React Test
- Global state management using the [zustand](https://github.com/pmndrs/zustand) library.
- some (fake) uploading functionality. (Nothing will be uploaded anywhere, but the app will look and feel "as if" when the user clicks the upload button.)
- reading and processing data from an API.

Since this one is supposed to show a few people how I approach a project of this kind, a web site documenting this project will be on-line soon. 

Feel welcome to join the journey, there's more to come, stay tuned!
